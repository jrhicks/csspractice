CSS Practice
======

Move along.  Just playing around with CSS Patterns I learned while watching freely available videos of CSSDay.io 2015.

In particular I'm playing around with

* Zero Global Style

* React CSS Modules

* No CSS Framework (Foundations, Bootstrap, etc)

* Semantic Style

Playing With Me
